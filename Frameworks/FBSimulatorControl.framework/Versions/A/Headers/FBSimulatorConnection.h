/**
 A Simulator Connection is a container for all of the relevant services that can be obtained when launching via: -[SimDevice bootWithOptions:error].
 Typically these are all the services with which Simulator.app can interact with, except that we have them inside FBSimulatorControl.

 The Constructor takes arguments that are a product of the booting process. These arguments *must* be provided when the connection is established.
 These arguments can be nil, but will not change during the lifetime of a connection.
 The 'Simulator Bridge' connection can be established lazily, that is to say the Bridge Connection can be made *after* the connection is created.
