/**
 'Shutting Down' a Simulator can be a little hairier than just calling '-[SimDevice shutdownWithError:]'.
 This method of shutting down takes into account a variety of error states and attempts to recover from them.

 Note that 'Shutting Down' a Simulator is different to 'terminating' or 'killing':
 - Killing a Simulator will kill the Simulator.app process.
 - Killing the Simulator.app process will soon-after get the SimDevice into a 'Shutdown' state in CoreSimulator.
 - This will take a number of seconds and represents an inconsistent state for the Simulator.
 - Calling Shutdown on a Simulator without terminating the Simulator.app process first will result in a 'Zombie' Simulator.
 - A 'Zombie' Simulator.app is a Simulator that isn't backed by a running SimDevice in CoreSimulator.

 Therefore this method should be called if:
 - A Simulator has no corresponding 'Simulator.app'. This is the case if `-[SimDevice bootWithOptions:error]` has been called directly.
 - After Simulator's corresponding 'Simulator.app' has been killed.
